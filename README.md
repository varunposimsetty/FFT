# FFT

## Project Overview

This project aims to design and implement an FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) in RTL (Register Transfer Level) using VHDL. Initially, I tried developing a Python script to perform FFT on two real-world signals: a song by Mozart and "Four Seasons" by Vivaldi (Copyright Free).  

The current Python implementation uses a straightforward DFT (Discrete Fourier Transform) which has a computational complexity of O(N^2). Later it was optimized to implement FFT - Optimized DFT, reducing the complexity to O(N log N). Following this, the FFT algorithm will be implemented in VHDL.
